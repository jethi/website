		<p>
			I am very curious, optimistic, love technology, just want to keep it simple and stay happy. I'm honoured to have amazing people in my life.

		<blockquote>
			‘The Great Man … is colder, harder, less hesitating, and without respect and without the fear of “opinion”; he lacks the virtues that accompany respect and “respectability”, and altogether everything that is the “virtue of the herd”. If he cannot lead, he goes alone. … He knows he is incommunicable: he finds it tasteless to be familiar. … When not speaking to himself, he wears a mask. There is a solitude within him that is inaccessible to praise or blame.’<br/>
			<br/>
