		<h1>Git Blast Sheet</h1>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Git feels like magic. Truly amazing tool. Best place to use is a UNIX-like system. You can also use Git Bash if you are using windows.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<br/>
		<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
		<br/>
		<p>
			After installing git it needs to be configured. Something like this:
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git config --global user.name "Arsh Jethi"
git config --global user.email "arshjethi@example.com"
git config --global --list
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Next, it is always nice to setup ssh for ease of use later. For that first we need to generate a set of asymmetric encryption keys:
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
ssh-keygen -t rsa
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			This generates encryption keys of type that use an algorithm called rsa.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Now we can conveniently copy the public key and put it in the Settings>SSH section of our remote repository (likely Github or Gitlab).
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<br/>
		<h2>New Local Repository</h2>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Initialize git in your project directory.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git init
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Add files to staging area. The dot add's all changed/added files. You can also stage individual files by naming them.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			You can create a file named .gitignore and list files in it that you don't want git to track.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git add .
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Commit what you added to staging area.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git commit -m 'message'
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Now, you can check status of your project directory.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git status
</pre>
		<hr/>
		<br/>
		<h2>Link to remote repository</h2>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Whatever we did so far was done on the local system. To sync this project with a remote repository we must create a new repository in our remote host and then link this project with that. The SSH keys setup before authenticates us. By default git creates branch named 'master'. While Github creates a branch named 'main'. To change the master branch to main we use the next command.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:jethi/repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Origin is a standard alias for the repository used when talking to remote repo. The git push above has '-u' flag, which means set-upstream. It is necessary to add this flag for the first time to link to the remote repository. This enable argument-less use of several commands like git-pull. I highly recommend reading the documentation.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Now, you can simply send the changes done in the recent commit to the remote repo by a simple.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git push
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			You can also fetch changes done in the repo by a fellow collaborator.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git pull
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Cloning a remote repo. You can clone a open-source remote repository on you system easily and even fetch changes done to the repo.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git clone repository-url
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			The repo cloned above would already be linked to upstream. But you can't push changes in it without appropiate permissions. You can always make a pull request though.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<br/>
		<h2>You made a mistake ?</h2>
		<br/>
		<p>
			If you added changes to staging area from mistake, you can unstage them like this:
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git reset HEAD file-name
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			We can also discard changes to a file done in a recent commit.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git checkout -- file-name
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Delete a file being tracked.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git rm file-name
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Rename a file being tracked.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git mv initial-name new-name
</pre>
		<hr/>
		<br/>
		<h2>The power of git</h2>
		<br/>
		<p>
			You can check your previous commits and revert to any of them. This can also be done for a single file. How cool is that ?
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			'git log' helps us do that:
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git help log
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Some ways to see previous commits:
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git log
git log --abbrev-commit
git log --oneline --graph --decorate
git log hash-from hash-to
git log --since="1 day ago"
</pre>
		<hr/>
		<br/>
		<h2>Branches</h2>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Basic stuff. I recommend learning more from the documentation.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			How to create a branch ? First let's list all branches.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git branch
git branch -a
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			The '-a' flag lists all branches local + remote. 'master' is the default branch.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Creating a new branch:
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git branch name-of-new-branch
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			To switch to another branch we use the term 'checkout':
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git checkout other-branch
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			We can also create and switch to a branch in one command:
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git checkout -b new-branch-name
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Rename a branch:
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git branch -m old-name new-name
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Deleting a branch:
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Note: A branch you are currently on cannot be deleted.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git branch -d name-of-branch
</pre>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Merging branches:
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Note: The branch name supplied below gets merged into the branch you are currently checked-in on.
		</p>
		<br/>
<pre>
git merge branch-name
</pre>
		<hr/>
		<br/>
		<p>
			That's it for now. Make sure you read more about branches, merging, merging vs rebasing and diff. Keep learning !!!
