		<h2>So, what is Gemini ?</h2>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Gemini is a protocol just like HTTP and Gopher. Provides more features than Gopher and less features than HTTP. Focus on simplicity, privacy and generality. I strongly recommend reading more about it at the official source.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>Why I like it ?</h2>
		<br/>
		<p>
			I discovered Gemini yesterday and the most exciting thing for me was how simple it was to understand the working under the hood.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			A working client in 100 lines of code and a TLS library ? It is amazing for introducing students to an internet protocol.

			That's all folks. Cheers
